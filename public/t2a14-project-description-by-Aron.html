  Description: I plan to make a short, two level, 2-D horror platformer/shooter, which contains enemies, power-ups, bullets,
          weapons, and animation. I plan on working through christmas break to add all these ideas into a comprehensive and playable project, and if there is time, I will
          attempt to make a multiplayer pvp stage as a bonus.
